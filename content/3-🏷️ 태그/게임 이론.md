Lessons from applied game theory

• Strategy = think ahead & prepare

– Big & important decision → You cannot do it instantaneously – Situation analysis → intelligence-based reasoning judgment

– Experience, training, spirits...

• Interactive reasoning – Players → payoff structure, possible moves

• Setting: not so many recognizable and interactable players • ‘Enemy vs. friends’? Stupid! → synthesizing confrontation and cooperation – Make or choose a game to your favor → initiative → winning tactics…

• Intelligence, propaganda, and mobilization • Human factor

• Food for thoughts

– Prisoners’ dilemma – Survival in ‘no man’s island’ – Mileage program – War & election: misunderstanding, counter-intelligence, psychology...
